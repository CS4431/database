Database Team
========

## Getting started
    git clone https://github.com/CS4431/database/
    cd database
    bundle install
    cd src
    ruby routes.rb
    
That will start the Sinatra web server and will start intercepting API requests.

## Generating docs
    cd database
    yard doc

A .yardopts file is already included in the repository, so it will store the documentation created in the right folder

### To do
* Create scraper
* Set-up database
* Write SQL wrapper
* Write JSON/XML generator
